About
...
I, Somto, a .NET developer, created the Swift Ecosystem to document my growth
and skills as I work towards becoming a full-stack developer.

The journey begins with the Introductory Hub, a console application that lays 
the foundation for exploring core .NET concepts. Future stages will showcase
backend development with ASP.NET Core, frontend development with ASP.NET MVC, 
and mobile solutions using .NET MAUI
